# Scripts
Making small scripts to solve some simpler problems
StartGaming: I have an old laptop that cannot handle multiple applications at once so i made a hotkey script that shuts down VSCode, Google, Edge etc and starts the game (valorant) all in one click. This script runs continuosly in the background waiting for me to game.
